   1.  The relations are irreflexive :

      1 cannot be later than 1 itself
       
       
   2. The relations are antisymmetric :

      If 1 is later than 2 it is impossible at the same time for 2 to be later than 1.
       
       
   3. The relations are transitive :

      If 1 is later than 2, 2 is later than 3 then 1 is also later than 3.
       
       
   4. The relations are anticyclic : This is actually just an extension of 2.) and 3.) :

      If 1 is later than 2, 2 is later than 3 then 3 can�t be later than 1.
